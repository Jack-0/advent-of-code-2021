# Advent of code 2021

My participation in the [2021 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)  <br>
<br>
I've challenged myself to complete all challenges before the end of December. <br>
Solution quality varies :see_no_evil:

## Running the code
Simply change into the directory and run the bash script, for example to run day01:
```
cd day01
./run.sh
```
## What I've learnt

- You can run python code in interactive mode by adding **-i**
- You can write **breakpoint()** in a function and use interactive mode to query state
